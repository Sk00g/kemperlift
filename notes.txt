--------------- :Data Types: ---------------
* Exercise
* Session
* Exercise Record
* Session Plan 

--------------- :Actions: ---------------
2. Create new session by selecting specific exercise or muscle groups - feature plan to include intensity preference 
4. View past sessions (which include / link to exercise records if completed)
5. View stastics like weight increase, muscle group percentage, favorite exercises, ignored exercises, etc.
7. Generate session plans (repeat future sessions based on 1 - 4 weeks of exercises on repeat, or the same sessions that repeat based on days with allowance for weekend schedules... must be flexible to allow cancellations and sick days, travel, etc.?)

(Design -> Research -> Prototype -> Write -> Test -> Document)
:STAGE:				Test

:IMMEDIATE:
Ran first usage and only crashed once due to changes in exercise name. Produced a number of ideas out of it:
1. Voice activation for enter session?
2. Synthetic speech as feedback (full hands-free)
3. Superset support
4. Goal setting on reps?
5. Errors in entry?
6. Aeriobic = allow for superset tolerance
7. Image of muscle groups for session summaries
